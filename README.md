# jasmine-runner

This package runs Jasmine 2.0 specs in a node-enabled browser window.


* Run specs via the`jasmine-runner:run-specs` command.
* Specs are required by evaluating the glob pattern `spec/**/-spec.js`
  relative to every directory in the current project. Also works for `.coffee`
  files.
